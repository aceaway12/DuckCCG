Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a tale the Jedi would tell you. Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise he could influence the midichlorians to create life. He had such an understanding of the Force he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He grew so powerful... the only thing he feared was losing his power, which, eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, and his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others but not himself.
